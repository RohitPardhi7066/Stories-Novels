    <h1>The Thirsty Crow</h1>
    <p>one hot day, a thirsty crow all over the fields looking for water. For a long time,he could not find any. He felt very week, almost lost all hope. Suddenly he saw a water jug below the tree. he fiew straight to see if there wa any water inside. Yes, he could see some water inside the jug</p>
    <p class="green">The crow tried to push his head into the jug. sadly he found that the neck of the jug was to narrow. Then he tried to ouch te jug to tiltfor the water to flow out, but the jug was to heavy.</p>
    <p>The crow tought hard for a while. Then, looking around it,he saw some pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug, As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the water level kept rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. His plan had worked!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Moral:Think and work hard, you may find solution to any problem.</p>
